## Sora 2 전용 프롬프트

### Scene 1A: 오프닝 - 고독감 (8초) - 버전 1
```
A deeply emotional cinematic scene: An elderly Korean grandmother, approximately 75 years old with gentle wrinkles and silver-gray hair tied in a small bun, sits alone at a worn wooden table in a modest studio apartment. The room is small but tidy, with traditional Korean elements - a small calendar on the wall, a rice cooker on the counter.

Late afternoon sunlight filters through thin white curtains, creating soft volumetric god rays. Her weathered hands rest on the table next to a smartphone that remains silent. A half-empty cup of cold barley tea sits untouched.

Camera movement: Begin with a wide establishing shot showing the entire lonely space, then slowly dolly in over 8 seconds to a medium close-up of her face, which shows quiet dignity mixed with profound loneliness. Her eyes occasionally glance at the phone, hoping.

Color grading: Desaturated blue-gray tones, cool color temperature (4500K), slight vignette to enhance isolation. Photorealistic rendering, shallow depth of field (f/2.8), subtle film grain for emotional texture. The atmosphere should feel like a contemplative art-house film - beautiful but melancholic.

Avoid: blur, distortion, artificial-looking CGI, overly dramatic lighting
```

### Scene 1B: 오프닝 - 고독감 (8초) - 버전 2 (더 강렬한 버전)
```
Heartbreaking realism: A solitary elderly Korean woman in her late 70s sits in a dimly lit one-room apartment. She wears a simple house dress and cardigan. The space tells a story - faded wallpaper, old family photos on the wall (barely visible in background blur), a wall clock ticking silently.

Golden hour light is fading, casting long shadows across the floor. She stares at an old-style flip phone on the table, her expression a mix of resignation and quiet hope. One hand gently touches a worn photo frame (out of focus).

Camera: Starts outside the room looking in through a doorway (voyeuristic, documentary feel), then slowly pushes through to reveal her isolation. Movement is patient, deliberate - 8 full seconds of gradual reveal.

Cinematography: Anamorphic lens characteristics with subtle horizontal flares, 2.39:1 aspect ratio feel. Color palette: Cool shadows with warm amber edge light from the window creating contrast. Realistic skin texture, age spots, fine wrinkles - honest and respectful portrayal. Depth of field gradually shifts from deep to shallow, isolating her.

Emotional tone: Quiet loneliness, dignity in solitude, universal human vulnerability

Technical specs: 24fps motion cadence, soft natural lighting, no harsh shadows, slight diffusion for gentle mood
```

### Scene 2A: 솔루션 소개 - 연결의 시작 (4초)
```
Hopeful transition moment: Close-up shot of a modern tablet (iPad-style) resting on the same wooden table from Scene 1. The screen suddenly lights up with a warm, friendly notification glow.

The interface shows the "ITDA" app (clean, accessible design with large fonts and warm colors). A notification appears: "새로운 이야기 친구가 연결되었습니다" (New story friend connected). Below, a friendly young woman's face appears in a small circle - she's a college student with a genuine, warm smile.

The elderly woman's hand (showing age spots and slight tremor - realistic detail) reaches into frame and gently taps the screen with hesitant but curious energy.

Camera: Tight close-up on the tablet, slightly overhead angle (bird's eye view at 45 degrees). Rack focus from the reflection of the grandmother's hopeful face on the black screen to the bright UI when it lights up.

Lighting: The screen casts a warm glow upward, illuminating the grandmother's face with hope. Practical light mixing - cool ambient room light + warm screen glow creating beautiful color contrast.

Color shift: Beginning of transition from cold blue-gray to warmer tones. The UI uses soft orange (#FF8C42) and peaceful green (#7FB685) - accessible, friendly colors.

Duration: 4 seconds of intimate detail

Technical: Photorealistic hand rendering, accurate tablet reflections, believable UI animation, natural hand movement with slight elderly tremor
```

### Scene 2B: 영상통화 - 진정한 연결 (8초)
```
Beautiful human connection moment: A warm video call scene split into two emotional beats.

Beat 1 (0-4s): Medium close-up of the elderly grandmother's face as she looks at the tablet screen. Her expression transforms from cautious to delighted - eyes crinkling with genuine joy, a shy smile forming. Soft wrinkles deepen around her eyes showing authentic happiness. She's bathed in the warm glow of the screen.

Beat 2 (4-8s): Elegant transition to split-screen composition. Left side: The grandmother animatedly sharing a story, her hands gesturing (traditional Korean storytelling style). Right side: The college student volunteer on the video call, leaning forward with genuine interest, nodding, smiling, occasionally laughing.

Background UI overlay (subtle, non-intrusive): Floating gentle graphics showing AI monitoring - small heartbeat icon with steady rhythm, mood indicator glowing soft green, temperature reading - all minimalist and transparent, never distracting from the human moment.

Camera: Slightly shaky handheld feel (very subtle) to add documentary intimacy. Slow push-in on both faces during the split-screen.

Lighting: Warm practical lights - the grandmother has soft table lamp light (tungsten 3200K) mixed with cool window light creating dimensional modeling. The student has modern LED ring light (5600K) typical of video calls. Both environments feel real and lived-in.

Emotional core: Inter-generational respect, genuine listening, rediscovered joy, mutual enrichment

Color grading: Warm amber and soft orange tones (LUT similar to "Kodak 2383"), slight glow/diffusion on highlights for emotional softness

Audio suggestion: Soft laughter, gentle Korean speech cadence, ambient room tone
```

### Scene 3A: 임팩트 몽타주 (6초)
```
Uplifting rapid montage - 4 quick vignettes showing the ripple effect:

Vignette 1 (1.5s): Different elderly man, 68, exercising gently (arm stretches) while on video call, volunteer cheering him on. Bright morning light, energetic but safe.

Vignette 2 (1.5s): Elderly woman, 72, showing old family photos to her screen, pointing and smiling. Volunteer on screen leaning close to see. Warm afternoon nostalgia.

Vignette 3 (1.5s): Elderly person cooking traditional Korean food (kimchi jjigae in a pot) while tablet propped up, chatting naturally like cooking with family. Steam rising, cozy kitchen.

Vignette 4 (1.5s): Group video call - three elderly people in small tiles, two volunteers, everyone laughing together. Community feeling, shared joy.

Each vignette: Different realistic Korean elderly individuals, diverse ages (late 60s to early 80s), various home environments (apartment, small house, modern senior living), all showing genuine engagement and happiness.

Camera: Dynamic but not chaotic - gentle whip pans between scenes, slight slow-motion on laughter (overcranked to 48fps then played at 24fps), intimate framing

Lighting: Each scene has different time-of-day lighting (morning, afternoon, evening, night) showing this is ongoing care, not just one moment. All warm and inviting.

Color: Vibrant but natural, warm golden hour color grade, slight glow on happy faces, beautiful bokeh in backgrounds (f/1.4 shallow DOF)

Emotional goal: Joy, community, sustained impact, life enrichment
```

### Scene 3B: 로고 reveal & 엔딩 메시지 (3초)
```
Powerful closing statement:

Final elderly face (from montage) holds on genuine smile for a beat, then elegant defocus blur as we pull focus to background.

The "ITDA" logo materializes in center frame - simple, modern Korean-English bilingual design. The logo animation feels organic, like it's made of warm light particles coming together (not corporate, but heartfelt).

Logo design suggestion:
- Korean "잇다" in soft, rounded Hangul font
- English "ITDA" below in clean sans-serif
- Subtle icon: two hands almost touching (Michelangelo-style) with gentle glow between them
- Colors: Warm orange gradient to soft pink

Text fades in below in both Korean and English:
"혼자가 아닙니다"
"You Are Not Alone"

Final frame statistics (subtle, lower thirds):
"외로움 85% 감소 | 응급상황 100% 조기 대응"
"85% Loneliness Reduction | 100% Emergency Early Response"

Background: Soft focus warm bokeh suggesting continued connection, slight lens breathing for organic feel

Camera: Slow push-in continues, ending on logo

Color: Golden hour glow (magic hour 6500K), warm and hopeful, slight lens flare (anamorphic style horizontal streak) for cinematic touch

Music cue: Orchestral swell reaching emotional peak then settling into warm resolution

Duration: 3 seconds of powerful messaging
```

## 트러블슈팅 가이드

### 문제 1: 인물 얼굴이 일관되지 않음

**해결책:**
1. 매우 구체적인 얼굴 묘사 사용
2. 나이, 인종, 헤어스타일, 특징적 요소 명시
3. 참조 이미지 사용 (가능한 경우)
4. 각 씬마다 동일한 캐릭터 묘사 복사-붙여넣기

**개선된 프롬프트:**
```
Before: "An elderly woman"
After: "A 75-year-old Korean grandmother with specific features: round face, gentle smile lines, silver hair in a neat low bun, small wire-frame glasses, warm brown eyes, wearing a beige knit cardigan"
```

### 문제 2: 움직임이 부자연스럽거나 어색함

**해결책:**
1. 액션을 작은 단위로 쪼개기
2. 물리학적으로 가능한 움직임만 요청
3. 속도 지정 ("slowly", "gently", "with hesitation")
4. 참조 가능한 실제 행동 묘사

**개선된 프롬프트:**
```
Before: "Hand touches screen"
After: "Elderly hand with slight natural tremor slowly enters frame from right, index finger extends with careful precision, approaches tablet screen gradually, gentle tap contact with realistic finger pad deformation"
```

### 문제 3: 조명이 이상하거나 일관성 없음

**해결책:**
1. 광원 명확히 지정 ("window light", "table lamp")
2. 색온도 수치 사용 ("3200K tungsten", "5600K daylight")
3. 조명 방향 명시 ("camera left", "backlight")
4. 시간대 설정 ("late afternoon", "golden hour")

**개선된 프롬프트:**
```
Before: "Good lighting"
After: "Lighting setup: Key light from large window camera right (diffused afternoon sun, 5200K), fill light from white wall bounce camera left, subtle rim light from practical table lamp (tungsten 3200K) creating warm edge. Soft shadows, no harsh highlights."
```

### 문제 4: 색감이 원하는 느낌과 다름

**해결책:**
1. 구체적 색상 코드 사용 (#FF8C42)
2. 영화/사진 참조 ("like Kodak Portra 400")
3. 색온도와 채도 수치
4. 무드보드 키워드 ("melancholic blue-gray", "hopeful warm amber")

**개선된 프롬프트:**
```
Before: "Sad colors"
After: "Color grading: Desaturated by 25%, blue channel +15 in shadows, slight cyan shift in mid-tones. Overall color temperature 4500K (cool, melancholic). Similar to decolorized Kodak Vision3 film stock. Subtle vignette."
```

### 문제 5: UI/텍스트가 잘 안 나옴 (특히 한글)

**해결책:**
1. Veo 3 사용 (UI에 더 강함)
2. 텍스트는 크고 명확하게 ("large, bold Korean text")
3. 텍스트 정확히 명시 ("잇다" not just "Korean app name")
4. UI 요소 하나씩 단계적 묘사
5. 후반작업에서 텍스트 오버레이 고려

**개선된 프롬프트:**
```
Before: "App interface with Korean text"
After: "Clean mobile UI displaying notification with exact text: '새로운 이야기 친구가 연결되었습니다' in large (18pt) Korean sans-serif font. High contrast: white text on gradient background (cream #FFF8E7 to warm white #FFFAF0). Text centered, clearly readable."
```

### 문제 6: 30초 타이밍이 안 맞음

**해결책:**
1. 각 씬을 개별 생성 후 편집 소프트웨어에서 합성
2. 씬별 정확한 초수 지정 (8s + 12s + 10s = 30s)
3. 여유있게 생성하고 트림
4. 오디오로 타이밍 조정 가능

**워크플로우:**
```
1. Scene 1: Generate 10s, use 8s (trim 2s)
2. Scene 2: Generate 14s, use 12s (trim 2s)
3. Scene 3: Generate 12s, use 10s (trim 2s)
4. Edit together with 0.5s cross-dissolve transitions
5. Final: Exactly 30.0s
```

### 문제 7: 감정이 진부하거나 과장됨

**해결책:**
1. "Subtle", "genuine", "understated" 키워드 사용
2. 미세 표정 묘사 ("slight smile", "gentle eye crinkle")
3. 할리우드 과장 피하기
4. 다큐멘터리 스타일 참조

**개선된 프롬프트:**
```
Before: "Very happy elderly person jumping with joy"
After: "Elderly woman's expression shows quiet joy - subtle lifting of mouth corners, soft crinkling around eyes, gentle relaxation of previously tense shoulders. Realistic, understated emotion, documentary-style authenticity."
```

## 마지막 조언

### 대상 수상을 위한 차별화 포인트

1. **스토리가 왕**: 아무리 기술이 좋아도 감동 없으면 의미 없음
2. **진정성**: 과장된 연출보다 진실된 순간 하나가 강력함
3. **디테일**: 작은 디테일(손의 떨림, 미세한 표정)이 몰입도 높임
4. **일관성**: 처음부터 끝까지 통일된 비주얼 톤 유지
5. **메시지**: 명확하고 기억에 남는 한 줄 메시지
6. **음악**: 영상의 50%는 음악. 신중히 선택
7. **타이밍**: 정확히 30초. 1초도 넘기지 말 것

### 최종 제출 전 확인사항
- [ ] 정확히 30.00초 (프레임 단위 확인)
- [ ] 사운드 믹싱 전문적 (너무 크거나 작지 않게)
- [ ] 자막 오타 없음 (한글/영문 모두)
- [ ] 색보정 일관성 (씬 간 색감 점프 없음)
- [ ] 로고 선명하고 읽기 쉬움
- [ ] 메시지 명확히 전달됨
